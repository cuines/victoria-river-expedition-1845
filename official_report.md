# Official Report of the Victoria River Expedition, 1845

**Submitted by:** Sir Thomas Mitchell, Colonial Explorer  
**Date of Submission:** 30 December 1845  
**To:** The Office of the Colonial Secretary

## Executive Summary

This report documents the findings of the Victoria River Expedition, undertaken between 15 March 1845 and 10 September 1845. The primary objective was to chart the course of the Victoria River, assess the surrounding lands for pastoral and agricultural potential, and identify routes for future settlement. The expedition successfully mapped the river for over 300 miles, discovered extensive tracts of fertile pastoral country, and overcame significant geographical obstacles. The discoveries made are of profound importance for the future expansion and prosperity of the colony.

## 1. Introduction and Objectives

Pursuant to instructions from the Colonial Office, the expedition set out from the settled districts of New South Wales with a party of twelve men, thirty horses, and provisions for six months. The principal aims were:

1. To trace the Victoria River to its source or until its course became impracticable.
2. To evaluate the quality of the land adjacent to the river for pastoral and agricultural use.
3. To identify any obstacles to travel and settlement, and to propose feasible routes for future expansion.
4. To record any notable geographical features, resources, and encounters with indigenous inhabitants.

## 2. Route and Chronology

*   **15 March 1845:** Departure from the forward depot at Cooper’s Creek.
*   **22 March – 10 April:** Initial ascent of the Victoria River, mapping its winding course through arid foothills.
*   **12 April – 5 May:** Entry into the upper basin, where the river broadens and the country becomes markedly more fertile.
*   **8 May:** Discovery of the extensive pastoral lands hereafter referred to as “Australia Felix” (see Issue #1).
*   **15 May – 20 June:** Negotiation of a rugged escarpment that presented a major barrier to progress (see Issue #2).
*   **25 June – 15 August:** Exploration of the northern watershed beyond the escarpment, confirming the river’s continuation and the presence of further well‑watered plains.
*   **10 September:** Return to the depot, completing the circuit.

## 3. Key Discoveries

### 3.1. The “Australia Felix” Pastoral Lands

The most significant discovery, as logged in Issue #1, was an expanse of exceptionally fertile country in the upper Victoria River basin. The soil is a deep, friable loam, abundantly watered by the river and numerous spring‑fed creeks. The vegetation consists of open grassy woodlands, providing ideal grazing for livestock. This region, estimated at over 500 square miles, represents the most promising pastoral land yet encountered in the northern interior. Its potential for supporting large‑scale sheep and cattle runs is immense, and its location, while remote, is accessible via the river corridor.

### 3.2. Water Resources and Climate

The Victoria River itself proved to be a permanent watercourse, with reliable pools even in the dry season. Several major tributaries were charted, each contributing to a robust hydrological system. The climate of the upper basin appears more temperate than the surrounding arid zones, with seasonal rains sufficient to maintain pasture growth. These conditions assure year‑round water availability for settlement and stock.

## 4. Obstacles and Challenges

### 4.1. The Rugged Escarpment Crossing

A formidable geographical obstacle, detailed in Issue #2, was encountered at approximately latitude 18°15′ S. A steep, rocky escarpment, rising some 800 feet, blocked direct passage along the river. After several days of reconnaissance, a practicable route was found via a series of narrow gullies on the eastern flank. This passage, though arduous, can be improved for future parties and eventually for stock movement. The escarpment marks a distinct boundary between the lower arid reaches and the fertile upper basin.

### 4.2. Logistical and Environmental Hardships

The expedition faced the usual privations of inland travel: extreme heat, limited forage for horses, and the constant threat of equipment failure. No hostile encounters with indigenous groups occurred, though signs of their presence were frequently observed. The party’s health remained generally good, thanks to careful rationing and the availability of fresh game.

## 5. Conclusions and Recommendations

1.  **Pastoral Expansion:** The “Australia Felix” lands should be surveyed immediately for pastoral leases. Their carrying capacity is estimated to be several hundred thousand sheep.
2.  **Route Development:** The escarpment crossing, while challenging, is negotiable. A graded track should be constructed to facilitate the movement of stock and supplies into the upper basin.
3.  **Further Exploration:** The country beyond the escarpment warrants detailed examination in a subsequent expedition. The Victoria River continues northward, possibly offering a route to the Gulf of Carpentaria.
4.  **Settlement Planning:** A government depot should be established at the confluence of the Victoria River and its major eastern tributary (marked on the accompanying maps) to serve as a base for future settlement and as a provisioning point for overlanders.

## 6. Attachments and References

*   **Map Series:** A set of twelve detailed maps documenting the river’s course, topography, and resource locations has been deposited with the Surveyor‑General’s office.
*   **Field Journals:** The complete daily journals of the expedition are available for consultation.
*   **Issue #1:** Discovery: The ‘Australia Felix’ Pastoral Lands.
*   **Issue #2:** Obstacle: The Rugged Escarpment Crossing.

## 7. Certification

I hereby certify that the foregoing is a true and accurate account of the Victoria River Expedition, conducted under my command, and that all observations and conclusions are presented to the best of my knowledge and belief.
