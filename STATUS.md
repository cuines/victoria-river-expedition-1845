## Outstanding Steps

### Issues Creation
The GitHub archival system's issue creation tool encountered an unexpected error. Consequently, the two required issues ("Discovery: The 'Australia Felix' Pastoral Lands" and "Obstacle: The Rugged Escarpment Crossing") could not be created via the automated protocol. These issues are referenced in the official report as #1 and #2. Manual creation of these issues is required to complete the catalogue of key discoveries and encounters.

### Release Creation
The GitHub release creation tool is not currently available in the archival system interface. Therefore, the final step of creating a tagged release (`v1.0.0`) titled "Published Report: Victoria River Expedition 1845" with a link to `official_report.md` could not be performed. This release should be created manually to mark the report as the definitive published account.

## Recommended Actions

1. **Create the two issues** using the GitHub web interface or another client, applying the labels `discovery`, `pastoral`, `obstacle`, and `geography` as appropriate.
2. **Create a GitHub release** tagged `v1.0.0` with the title "Published Report: Victoria River Expedition 1845" and release notes that include a direct link to the [`official_report.md`](https://github.com/cuines/victoria-river-expedition-1845/blob/main/official_report.md) file.

Once these manual steps are completed, the archival process will be fully compliant with the Colonial Secretary's protocol.
